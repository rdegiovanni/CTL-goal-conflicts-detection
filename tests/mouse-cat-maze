--This is a traffic control problem of a mouse in a maze. The maze, shown in Figure 4, consists of five rooms connected by various one-way passages, where some of them can be closed through control. There is also a cat which alway stays in room 1. The mouse is initially in room 0, but it can visit other rooms by using one-way passages. Our task is to design a supervisor to control the passages in order to guarantee that

Goals:
--Spec 1 The mouse never visits room 1 where the cat stays (this is a safety property).
AG(!m1);

--Spec 2 The mouse can go to room 0 for play at any time it wants to (this is a nonblocking property).
AG(AF(m0));

--Spec 3 The mouse shall visit room 2 for food infinitely often (this is a liveness property).
AG(AF(m2));

--Spec 4 The mouse shall never be locked in a room (this is a nonterminating property).
AG(AF(m0 || m1 || m2 ||m3 || m4))
Domain:
--initially the mouse is in room 0
m0;
--model the possible movements of the mouse
AG(m0 -> AX(m2));
